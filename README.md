# Mad-libs-python-projects
In this mad lib app, I use tkinter for the GUI. and ask the user for some keywords and generate an intresting story for them.
we started by importing tkinter
and then, we create the functions for the story 1 and 2. 

Last but not least we initialize our program's main screen
